-- Step 5. Test results to see if they are as expected

-- Q2: How to keep track of when a record was last modified?
-- A2: Maybe use an after update trigger

-- Remove stuff if it is already there
DELETE FROM dbo.t_hello_world
	WHERE my_message IN('Hello World2' , 'Hello World3' , 'Hello World4');


-- Load test rows

INSERT INTO dbo.t_hello_world(my_message , current_date_time)

VALUES	('Hello World2', GETDATE()) , 
		('Hello World3' , GETDATE());


-- See if the trigger worked
SELECT t.*

	FROM dbo.t_hello_world AS  t;


-- Try it again
UPDATE dbo.t_hello_world SET my_message = 'Hello World4'

WHERE my_message = 'Hello World3';

-- See if the trigger worked
SELECT t.*

	FROM dbo.t_hello_world AS t;
